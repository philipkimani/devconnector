# devconnector
This is a learning project that I will use to hone my development skills and as a motivation to build a web app that can apply to agricultural
to connect buyers and sellers and middlemen as well, and maybe in fashion sector where ML can be applied to ingest data in real time to 
create/suggest a new design for the customer, in addition to other ideas that may come up along the way.
